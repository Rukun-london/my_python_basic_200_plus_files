# My Python Progress 🚀

This repository documents my journey as I learn Python through hands-on practice. Each script explores a different concept — from control flow and loops to functions and number theory.

## 📂 Structure

- `tests/` — Practice scripts (leap year checks, Fibonacci, prime validation, etc.)
- `source/` — Core logic and reusable functions
- `.idea/` — PyCharm project settings (auto-generated)

## 🧠 Goals

- Build strong fundamentals in Python
- Experiment with different logic styles (boolean, loops, functions)
- Track progress and reflect on learning

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.14
- PyCharm IDE
- Git for version control

## 📈 What's next

- Add sorting algorithms and visualizations
- Explore object-oriented programming
- Build mini projects (calculator, game, etc.)
